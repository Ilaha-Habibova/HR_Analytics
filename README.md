# HR_Analytics
I worked on this project to analyze HR Excel data of the company AtliQ  using Power BI.

## Dataset Used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Ilaha-Habibova/HR_Analytics/blob/main/Attendance%20Sheet%202022-2023_Masked.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Objectives:
The company operated in a hybrid work model, with some employees working from the office and others remotely. They needed insights into employee attendance and presence over the past three months.

## Key Questions Answered:
1) What percentage of employees were present?
2) What are the work preferences (remote vs. office attendance)?
3) How many employees took sick leave?

## Insights:
- The overall presence percentage across the observed months remains consistently high-above 89% across all months, indicating strong employee attendance, with a peak of 94.05% in April 2022.
- WFH(work from home) rates are generally low, reaching a maximum of 11.23% in May 2022.
- Sick leave percentages remain low, with a maximum of 1.68% in May 2022, which points to good employee health and effective health management.
- Both WFH and sick leave percentages show variations from month to month, particularly in May 2022, which may indicate seasonal influences or specific events impacting employee availability.
